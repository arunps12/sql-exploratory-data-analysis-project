# sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project
This project is inspired by an online course offered by [Data With Baraa](https://www.youtube.com/@DataWithBaraa) and contains a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts demonstrating various analytical and data exploration techniques.  
Each script focuses on a specific aspect of data analysis — from database setup to advanced analytical patterns such as trend tracking, cumulative metrics, and performance evaluation.
## 📁 Contents

| File Name | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **00_init_database.sql** | Initializes the sample database structure and data. |
| **01_database_exploration.sql** | Basic exploration of database tables and schemas. |
| **02_dimensions_exploration.sql** | Analyzes data dimensions and relationships. |
| **03_date_range_exploration.sql** | Investigates data distributions over date ranges. |
| **04_measures_exploration.sql** | Examines and validates numerical measures. |
| **05_magnitude_analysis.sql** | Compares relative sizes and magnitudes of data values. |
| **06_ranking_analysis.sql** | Performs ranking and ordering analysis (e.g., TOP-N queries). |
| **07_change_over_time_analysis.sql** | Analyzes data changes and trends over time. |
| **08_cumulative_analysis.sql** | Calculates running totals and cumulative metrics. |
| **09_performance_analysis.sql** | Evaluates performance and growth metrics. |
| **10_data_segmentation.sql** | Segments data into meaningful categories. |
| **11_part_to_whole_analysis.sql** | Analyzes proportions and part-to-whole relationships. |
| **12_report_customers.sql** | Generates reports summarizing customer data. |
| **13_report_products.sql** | Generates reports summarizing product data. |

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open each `.sql` script in your preferred SQL environment (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio).
2. Run `00_init_database.sql` first to create and populate the sample database.
3. Execute other scripts as needed to explore analytical concepts.

## 🧩 Analytical Techniques Covered

- Trend and change-over-time analysis  
- Cumulative and running totals  
- Performance and growth measurement  
- Data segmentation and ranking  
- Part-to-whole (composition) analysis  
- Database and dimension exploration

## 💡 Note

> Update database and table names in scripts as per your environment before execution.
